# AppGini Documentation

This repository contains the source files (in Markdown format) used for the [AppGini documentation](https://bigprof.com/appgini/help).

[AppGini](https://bigprof.com/appgini/) is a web application development environment that dramatically reduces the time and effort required to create data-driven web applications.
It enables you to create data-driven web applications without having to write any code. You can use it to create custom web applications for
managing your data, your processes, and your customers.

## Document format

The documentation is written in Markdown format. Each page is a separate Markdown file in the `pages` directory. The `index.md` file contains the documentation homepage content.
Front matter is used to specify the title, link title (as it appears in the TOC menu), and slug of each page.
In general, the front matter follows the same rules of [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/), though Hugo is not used to generate this documentation.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the documentation, please fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
