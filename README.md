# AppGini Documentation

This repository contains the source files (in Markdown format) used for the [AppGini documentation](https://bigprof.com/appgini/help).

[AppGini](https://bigprof.com/appgini/) is a web application development environment that dramatically reduces the time and effort required to create data-driven web applications.
It enables you to create data-driven web applications without having to write any code. You can use it to create custom web applications for
managing your data, your processes, and your customers.

If you'd like to contribute to the documentation, please fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
