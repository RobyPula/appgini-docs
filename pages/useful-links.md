### Setting up a test environment for your web applications

You can test your AppGini-generated web applications on a local machine
before deploying them online. To do so, you need to install a [web
server](http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi) ,
[MySQL](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) , and
[PHP](http://www.php.net/downloads.php) . Of course, installing and
configuring all of these programs is a lot of headache. Fortunately,
there is an easier way: download and install
[Xampp](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html) , a single
download that takes care of all the necessary work in one shot.

**Note:** All of the above tools are free and open source software.


### Uploading the generated code to your server

To upload the generated code to your server, you should use an FTP
client. A very powerful program is
[FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php) .


### Our online course on customizing AppGini applications

We prepared a course for power users of AppGini, who'd like to add more
functionality to their applications by writing custom code. Through 4.5
hours of video, you'll finish 30 practical examples, featuring more than
500 lines of code, that cover the most common hook questions we receive
from users. [Preview the
course](https://www.udemy.com/course/customizing-appgini-web-applications/?referralCode=CCDB276736BE1ADE99B9).


### Hosting providers

Most hosting providers support hosting the applications generated by
AppGini out-of-the-box, since AppGini generates PHP applications that
connect to MySQL databases. PHP and MySQL are very widely available
through almost any hosting provider.

If you're looking for a very easy to use and **highly reliable cloud
hosting service** , we've been using [Digital
Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/d30b7a2609f4) for many years and are quite
content with their simplicity and reliability. This [special
link](https://m.do.co/c/d30b7a2609f4) provides you with \$100 credit to
try their service.

Digital Ocean however requires some experience managing your server
updates and software installations (they have [many detailed
guides](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials) for that
though). If you're looking for managed hosting (where the provider
takes care of installing, securing and upgrading your server software,
as well as resolving the majority of technical issues),
[Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/) is a very good
option.

A good source of information regarding hosting providers is the
[webhostingtalk forum](https://www.webhostingtalk.com/) .


### Code management

If you plan to manually edit the generated code, you should be careful
to avoid overwriting your modifications in case you regenerate the code
later. CVS software helps greatly with organizing and versioning your
code. It makes it very easy to undo (revert) harmful changes, and merge
your modifications into newly generated code. One such great, easy and
free program is [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/) . We have a
[tutorial on how to use it with AppGini
code](/appgini/screencasts/how-to-use-git-with-appgini-to-manage-code-changes)
.
