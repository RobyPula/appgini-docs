# Working with tables and records

## The application homepage

This page provides links to accessible tables in your application,
depending on the group permissions of the logged user. We shall select
the Customers Table.

## The Table View page

Here you can navigate data records of your table and edit, add and
delete records. As shown in the figure below, the table view shows data
in a table where records appear in rows, and each column represents a
field of the table.

**Column headers** are specified in your AppGini project (as field captions).
If you click on any of them, the table is sorted ascendingly by the
clicked field. The figure below shows our table sorted by Country.

If you click again on the 'Country' header, it will be sorted
descendingly. You can sort any field by simply clicking on its column
header once or twice (to sort ascendingly or descendingly).

## The Detail View

The detail view page can be used to enter data of a new
record. To do so, click the \"ADD NEW\" button. In addition, when you
click on any record in the table, its data is displayed in the Detail
View for viewing, editing,
deleting, printing, and/or copying to a new record. The exact functions
enabled depend on the permissions of the logged user.

To sum up, the table view allows you to control and manage data of the
table by allowing you to insert new records, edit and delete records;
sort and navigate data, filter data or move to any other table. All this
can be done in one page in an easy to understand manner.

Remember that you can control the appearance of the table view through
[Project
Styles](/appgini/help/working-with-projects/working-with-styles) in
AppGini. You can also control table view and detail view layouts by
editing the [generated template
files](/appgini/help/working-with-generated-web-database-application) .
