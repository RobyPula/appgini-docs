This tab allows you to configure your field to be displayed as a web-link, an image, a file, a google map or even a YouTube video.

## Link option

Configure the way your field behaves when clicked. It can be configured to open the detail view of the current record, a URL, an email link, or not be clickable at all.

If you configure the field to display as a web-link and the user clicks that field, the link is opened in a new window.

## Google Maps

You can add a google map to your records, simply by creating a new field having any textual data type and setting the field length to 200 or more.

![Google Map option](https://cdn.bigprof.com/appgini-desktop/help/appgini-5.40/google_map_appgini.png)

Google Maps require a [Google API key](/appgini/google-maps-api-key) to work correctly. You can add one by simply clicking the settings dialog to get a key. This allows you to insert interactive maps into your application.
