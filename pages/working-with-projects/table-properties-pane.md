[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Table view title

The table view title is the title of the table as it will appear in the pages of the generated PHP application.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Description

If you provide a description for the table, this description will be displayed in the home page of the generated application. You can use HTML code in this description.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Records per page

The number of records that appear on one page in the generated PHP application. Records are displayed as horizontal rows of a table. If you put a large number here, your application user might have to scroll down the page to view records.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Show quick search box

If you want to display a quick search box above the table view, check this option. When the user enters a word in that search box and clicks the search button or presses Enter key, the table is searched for matches in any field. This is much easier than the advanced filters if you want a simple search technique.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Default sort by,Descendingly

If you'd like records in the table view sorted by default, select the field that you want to sort by from the 'Default sort by' drop down. The default sorting direction is ascendingly (A-Z, 0-9) unless you check the 'Descendingly' option. If you don't want any default sorting, select 'None' from the 'Default sort by' drop down.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Allow sorting

This option controls whether users are allowed to sort records in the table or not. Note that this doesn't affect the table in the database, only the query that displays data to the user.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Allow filters

This option controls whether users are allowed to filter records in the table or not. Note that this doesn't affect the table in the database, only the query that displays data to the user.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Allow saving data to CSV files

If you check this option, users will see a Save button above the table view that allows them to save data as a CSV file (Comma-Separated values).

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Allow print-view

This option controls whether users are allowed to view the table data as a printer-friendly page.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Allow users to save filters

If you check this option, users will see a Save button in the filters page. If they click this Save button, they will view some HTML code that they can copy and paste to any external web page. This HTML code creates a button linking users to the filtered table view (without having to redefine filters). TIP: Usually, you would want to allow this option temporarily till all users have determined which preset filters they want to save. Later on, you can disable this option and regenerate the code.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Hide link in homepage

If checked, this table will not have a link to it in the homepage of the generated application. Usually used with the option 'Hide link in navigation menu' checked as well. This is useful for example if this is a child table and you want users to access it only from its parent table rather than directly through a link.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Allow mass delete

This option controls whether users who have permission to delete records can delete multiple records at once.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Filter before showing table view

When this option is checked, users see the filters page first before seeing the table data. This is useful if you want users to search the table and display the search results to them.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Hide link in navigation menu

If checked, this table will not have a link to it in the navigation menu of the generated application. Usually used with the option 'Hide link in homepage' checked as well. This is useful for example if this is a child table and you want users to access it only from its parent table rather than directly through a link.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Show record count in Homepage

Check this option to display the count of accessible records of this table in the application homepage.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Table group

Click this button to open the Table group dialog, where you can group tables for easier navigation.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Table template

Click this button to open the Table view template dialog, where you can configure layout options of the table view for this table.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Detail view title

The title of the detail view form. The detail view form is where users can edit and add data to the table.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Redirect after insert

If you type a web address here, users will be sent to that address after they insert a new record. If you leave this box empty, users will be sent to the table view page. If you add the characters #ID# as part of the web address, they will get replaced by the primary key value of the newly inserted record. For example, these are valid addresses that you can put into the box: thanks.html

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Display a link to children records from

If you have lookup fields in other tables whose parent table is set to the current table, you'll find them listed here as children tables. If you check any of the children tables listed here, users will see a link to that table displayed in the detail view when a record is selected from the current (parent) table. This link displays records of the child table related to the current parent record. For example, you may have an artists table, and a songs table. The songs table has an 'Artist' field whose parent table is the artists table. Using this feature, users who select an artist from the artists table will see a 'songs' link in the detail view of the selected artist. Clicking on that songs link, users will see all the songs that belong to the selected artist.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Default focus field

Specify which field (if any) is focused by default when the user opens the detail view.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Enable detail view

Use this option to control whether users can see the detail view or not.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Allow detail print-view

If you check this option, users will see a 'Print preview' button in the detail view when selecting a record. Clicking that button would display a printer-friendly view of the selected record.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Hide 'Save As Copy' when editing

By default, when a user selects a record for editing, the 'Save As Copy' button is displayed in the detail view so that the user can save a copy of the selected field. Checking this option would disable this behavior and the 'Save As Copy' button won't be displayed.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Allow adding new records from Homepage

If you check this option, users with insert permission can directly add records to this table from the homepage, without having to navigate to the table and click the Add new button in there.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Delete records even if they have children records

The default behavior when a user tries to delete a record is that the AppGini-generated code will check to see if this record has one or more child records (records that have lookup fields pointing to the record to be deleted). If one or more children are found, the record is not deleted.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Display detail view in a separate page

If you check this option, the detail view (the form where users can add or insert records) will be displayed in a separate page instead of below the table view.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Keep action buttons visible while scrolling down

For long detail view forms, we recommend checking this option so that the action buttons (Save changes, Back, Print preview, Delete, .. etc) are always visible to the user, without having to scroll up/down to find them.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Table technical documentation

This section is where you can edit and preview the technical documentation of this table. The technical documentation is useful for adding notes and technical descriptions for your project, tables and fields. It's not visible to your app users, but can be viewable in the admin area if the option Show technical documentation page in the admin area under project properties is checked.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Edit Technical Documentation

Click this button to open the technical documentation editor for this table.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Technical documentation preview

Here you can see a preview of the technical documentation for this table.

[back to top](#map-link)

This feature is enabled only if the current table has children tables. Displays settings for showing the children records in the detail view.

[back to top](#map-link)

## Table properties > Table icon

[back to top](#map-link)
